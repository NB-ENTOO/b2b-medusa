1. A suite of commerce modules with core functionalities like inventory tracking, cart calculations, and order management
2. A framework for building custom business logic, APIs, data models, workflows, and third-party integrations
3. A customizable admin dashboard for merchants to manage their store

## Key Architectural Concepts

### Headless Architecture

Medusa follows a headless architecture, separating the backend commerce logic from the frontend presentation layer. This approach offers several benefits:

- **Flexibility**: Use any frontend technology (React, Vue, etc.) with Medusa's backend
- **Scalability**: Scale frontend and backend independently
- **Performance**: Optimize each layer separately for better performance
- **Omnichannel**: Serve multiple frontend experiences (web, mobile, in-store) from a single backend

### Service-Oriented Design

Medusa uses a service-oriented architecture, where each piece of functionality is encapsulated in a service:

- **Services**: Handle business logic and data operations
- **Controllers**: Manage API endpoints and request handling
- **Subscribers**: Listen for and react to events
- **Repositories**: Interface with the database
- **Models**: Define data structures and relationships

### Plugin System

Medusa's plugin system allows for extending functionality without modifying core code:

- **Core Plugins**: Add payment providers, fulfillment methods, and more
- **Custom Plugins**: Build and share custom functionality
- **Community Plugins**: Use plugins developed by the Medusa community

## Use Cases and Applications

Medusa is suitable for a wide range of commerce applications:

- **B2C E-commerce**: Traditional online stores and marketplaces
- **B2B Commerce**: Wholesale, distribution, and enterprise sales platforms (like our NET-BRIDGE project)
- **Omnichannel Retail**: Unified commerce across online and offline channels
- **Subscription Commerce**: Recurring billing and subscription management
- **Marketplace Platforms**: Multi-vendor marketplaces and platforms
- **Custom Commerce Solutions**: Unique commerce experiences with custom workflows

## Getting Started

To start developing with Medusa, you typically need:

1. Node.js and npm/yarn installed
2. PostgreSQL database
3. Redis for caching and queues
4. Medusa CLI for project initialization and development tasks

The basic project setup involves:

```bash
# Install Medusa CLI
npm install @medusajs/medusa-cli -g

# Create a new project
npx create-medusa-app

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
