# NET-BRIDGE Project Active Context

## Current Focus
- Creative phase (CREATIVE mode) completed
- Implementation phase preparation
- All design decisions finalized
- Ready for development
- Medusa.js documentation referenced and analyzed

## Project Structure Assessment
- The project uses Medusa B2B Starter as a foundation
- Backend directory contains Medusa.js 2.6.1 setup
- Storefront directory contains Next.js frontend
- Both directories have their own configuration files and dependencies

## Platform Detection
- Development Environment: Windows 10 (win32 10.0.19045) using Cursor AI app
- Deployment Environment: Ubuntu LXC running on Proxmox
- Containerization: Docker with PostgreSQL and Redis services
- Shell: /bin/bash
- Path Separator: Forward Slash (/)
- Command Adaptations: Linux-style commands
- Interface Access: Admin panel and storefront UI started with "yan dev" command
- Validation: Starter pack successfully tested before Memory Bank initialization

## Project Objectives
- Create an enterprise-grade IT equipment e-commerce platform
- Replicate ETB Tech functionality with modernized UI based on Medusa B2B Starter
- Focus on custom configuration and quotation generation
- Ensure mobile optimization
- Deploy using Docker for local hosting
- Implement four key systems:
  1. Product catalog with detailed specifications
  2. Custom configuration system with compatibility checking
  3. Quotation system with PDF generation
  4. Modern, responsive user interface

## Planning Documents Created
- planning.md - Comprehensive planning document with requirements and implementation strategy
- architecture.md - System architecture, data flow, and integration points
- implementation.md - Detailed implementation roadmap with risk management
- creative-phases.md - Design exploration plans for UI/UX, architecture, and algorithms
- objectiveUpdate.md - Summary of project objectives from objective.md
- medusaDocs.md - Reference for Medusa.js documentation and code patterns

## Medusa.js Technical Insights
- Commerce modules for product catalog, inventory, and cart functionality
- Customization framework for extending data models and APIs
- UI component library for building the configuration interface
- Custom service patterns for quotation generation and PDF creation
- Docker deployment architecture aligned with project requirements
- B2B commerce capabilities that support our enterprise use case

## Creative Phases Completed
- ✅ UI/UX Design for the custom configuration interface
  - Decision: Tab-Based Configuration with Summary Panel
  - Balances focused decision-making with overall visibility
  - Adapts well to both desktop and mobile interfaces
  - Provides persistent summary panel for real-time feedback

- ✅ Architecture Design for the custom quotation system
  - Decision: Hybrid Approach with Cart Transformation
  - Leverages existing cart for product selection
  - Creates dedicated quotation entity after conversion
  - Supports both configured and non-configured products
  - Includes PDF generation and email delivery

- ✅ Algorithm Design for component compatibility and pricing
  - Decision: Rule-Based Compatibility Engine
  - Flexible rules stored in database
  - Maintainable through admin interface
  - Provides real-time validation and feedback
  - Supports complex pricing calculations

## Complexity Assessment
This project is classified as **Level 3** (Intermediate Feature) due to:
- Multiple complex subsystems (product catalog, configuration, quotation)
- Integration between different technologies
- Custom UI requirements with responsive design
- Docker-based deployment requirements

## Next Steps
CREATIVE mode has been completed successfully. The project now requires transition to IMPLEMENT mode to begin development based on the design decisions.

Type 'IMPLEMENT' to switch to implementation mode.
