# NET-BRIDGE Project Active Context

## Current Focus
- Project planning phase (PLAN mode) completed
- Creative phase preparation for design exploration
- Implementation roadmap established
- Objective scan and verification completed
- Medusa.js documentation referenced and analyzed

## Project Structure Assessment
- The project uses Medusa B2B Starter as a foundation
- Backend directory contains Medusa.js 2.6.1 setup
- Storefront directory contains Next.js frontend
- Both directories have their own configuration files and dependencies

## Platform Detection
- Operating System: Windows 10 (win32 10.0.19045)
- Shell: /bin/bash
- Path Separator: Forward Slash (/)
- Command Adaptations: Linux-style commands

## Project Objectives
- Create an enterprise-grade IT equipment e-commerce platform
- Replicate ETB Tech functionality with modernized UI based on Medusa B2B Starter
- Focus on custom configuration and quotation generation
- Ensure mobile optimization
- Deploy using Docker for local hosting
- Implement four key systems:
  1. Product catalog with detailed specifications
  2. Custom configuration system with compatibility checking
  3. Quotation system with PDF generation
  4. Modern, responsive user interface

## Planning Documents Created
- planning.md - Comprehensive planning document with requirements and implementation strategy
- architecture.md - System architecture, data flow, and integration points
- implementation.md - Detailed implementation roadmap with risk management
- creative-phases.md - Design exploration plans for UI/UX, architecture, and algorithms
- objectiveUpdate.md - Summary of project objectives from objective.md
- medusaDocs.md - Reference for Medusa.js documentation and code patterns

## Medusa.js Technical Insights
- Commerce modules for product catalog, inventory, and cart functionality
- Customization framework for extending data models and APIs
- UI component library for building the configuration interface
- Custom service patterns for quotation generation and PDF creation
- Docker deployment architecture aligned with project requirements
- B2B commerce capabilities that support our enterprise use case

## Creative Phases Identified
- üé® UI/UX Design for the custom configuration interface
- üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design for the custom quotation system
- ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Design for component compatibility and pricing

## Complexity Assessment
This project is classified as **Level 3** (Intermediate Feature) due to:
- Multiple complex subsystems (product catalog, configuration, quotation)
- Integration between different technologies
- Custom UI requirements with responsive design
- Docker-based deployment requirements

## Next Steps
PLAN mode has been completed successfully. The project now requires transition to CREATIVE mode for detailed design exploration before implementation begins.

Type 'CREATIVE' to switch to creative mode for design exploration.
