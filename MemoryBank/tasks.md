# NET-BRIDGE E-commerce Platform Project Tasks

## Project Overview
NET-BRIDGE is an enterprise-grade IT equipment e-commerce platform for IT solutions providers who sell enterprise equipment. The platform should provide a modern, responsive UI with custom product configuration capabilities and quotation generation.

## Current Status
- Project initialization phase (VAN mode)
- Based on Medusa B2B Starter template
- Initial files and structures verified
- Implementing Phase 5: Quotation System (Backend Models)
- Encountered linter errors after creating models and module structure, likely due to stale TS server state.
- Next step: Reload editor to resolve errors, then generate/run migrations.

## Project Structure
- Backend: Medusa.js 2.6.1
- Frontend: Next.js 14
- Admin Panel: Medusa Admin
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Caching: Redis
- Containerization: Docker and Docker Compose

  - [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile/desktop
  - [ ] Develop component selection interface
  
- [ ] **Phase 4: Compatibility and Pricing Engine**
  - [x] Design compatibility algorithm (Decision: Rule-Based Compatibility Engine)
  - [ ] Implement rule model and storage
  - [ ] Create rule evaluation service
  - [ ] Develop pricing calculation engine
  - [ ] Build admin interface for rule management

- [ ] **Phase 5: Quotation System**
  - [x] Design quotation architecture (Decision: Hybrid Approach with Cart Transformation)
  - [ ] Implement cart to quote transformation
  - [~] Create quotation data models // In progress, blocked by linter errors
  - [ ] Develop PDF generation service
  - [ ] Build email notification system
  - [ ] Create customer information collection form

- [ ] **Phase 6: UI Enhancement**
  - [ ] Modernize interface based on Medusa B2B Starter
  - [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness
  - [ ] Implement product comparison features

- [ ] **Phase 7: Deployment**
  - [ ] Finalize Docker deployment
  - [ ] Create deployment documentation
  - [ ] Configure for local hosting 

## Design Decisions

### UI/UX Design: Custom Configuration Interface
- Selected approach: Tab-Based Configuration with Summary Panel
- Key features:
  - Logical organization of options in tabs
  - Persistent summary panel showing selections and price
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile
  - Real-time feedback on compatibility

### Architecture Design: Custom Quotation System
- Selected approach: Hybrid Approach with Cart Transformation
- Key features:
  - Uses cart for product selection and validation
  - Transforms cart to quotation for finalization
  - Supports both configured and non-configured products
  - Includes PDF generation and email delivery

### Algorithm Design: Compatibility and Pricing Engine
- Selected approach: Rule-Based Compatibility Engine
- Key features:
  - Flexible rules stored in database
  - Admin interface for rule management
  - Real-time validation and feedback
  - Support for complex pricing calculations

## Next Steps
1.  **Reload Editor/Restart IDE:** To force the TypeScript language server to refresh and hopefully resolve the linter errors in the quote module files.
2.  **Verify Linter Errors:** Confirm that errors in `index.ts` and model files are gone.
3.  **Generate Migration:** Run `medusa db:generate` for the new `Quotation` and `QuotationItem` tables.
4.  **Run Migration:** Execute the migration using `medusa db:migrate`.
5.  Continue with Phase 5 implementation (services, etc.) or address other pending phases.

## Session Summary (YYYY-MM-DD - End of Day)

**Goal:** Implement Phase 5 - Quotation System Backend Models.

**Progress:**

1.  **Project Structure Correction:** Identified and fixed an issue where the `quote` module was incorrectly created in the root `src` directory instead of `backend/src`. Moved `src/modules/quote` to `backend/src/modules/quote` and removed the extraneous root `src` folder.
2.  **Package Installation:** Added `@medusajs/utils` package as it's needed for `generateEntityId`.
3.  **Model Creation:**
    *   Created the `Quotation` entity model in `backend/src/modules/quote/models/quotation.model.ts`.
    *   Created the `QuotationItem` entity model in `backend/src/modules/quote/models/quotation-item.model.ts`.
4.  **Module Registration:**
    *   Created the module index file `backend/src/modules/quote/index.ts`.
    *   Configured `index.ts` to export the `QUOTE_MODULE` key and the module definition containing the `Quotation` and `QuotationItem` models.
    *   Verified that `backend/medusa-config.ts` already correctly referenced the `QUOTE_MODULE` and its path.

**Current Status & Blocker:**

*   Persistent linter errors in `index.ts` and the model files (`quotation.model.ts`, `quotation-item.model.ts`) indicating "Cannot find module" for relative paths (`./models/...`) and potentially unresolved decorator issues.
*   **Hypothesis:** The TypeScript language server/editor state is likely stale after the file moves, creations, and package installation. The dev server is not running.

**Next Steps (Tomorrow):**

1.  **Reload Editor/Restart IDE:** To force the TypeScript language server to refresh and hopefully resolve the linter errors.
2.  **Verify Linter Errors:** Confirm that errors in `index.ts` and model files are gone.
3.  **Generate Migration:** Run `medusa db:generate` (or the equivalent command for the `quote` module if needed) to create the database migration script for the new `Quotation` and `QuotationItem` tables.
4.  **Run Migration:** Execute the migration using `medusa db:migrate`.
