- [x] Project complexity assessment: **Level 3**
- [x] Project requirements documented in projectbrief.md
- [x] Initial tasks outlined in tasks.md

## Planning Phase (PLAN Mode)
- [x] Comprehensive planning documents created
  - Created planning.md (requirements analysis, component analysis, implementation strategy)
  - Created architecture.md (system architecture, data flow, integration points)
  - Created implementation.md (detailed roadmap, testing strategy, risk management)
  - Created creative-phases.md (UI/UX, architecture, and algorithm design planning)
- [x] Project scope defined and documented
- [x] Implementation strategy outlined
- [x] Creative phases identified and planned
- [x] Risk assessment performed
- [x] Technical documentation added
  - Created objectiveUpdate.md (summary of project objectives)
  - Created medusaDocs.md (Medusa.js documentation reference)

## Creative Phase (CREATIVE Mode)
- [x] Creative phase completed
- [x] UI/UX Design for configuration interface
  - Decision: Tab-Based Configuration with Summary Panel
  - Provides balance between focused attention and overview
  - Includes responsive design for mobile and desktop
- [x] Architecture Design for quotation system
  - Decision: Hybrid Approach with Cart Transformation
  - Supports both configured and non-configured products
  - Includes PDF generation and email delivery
- [x] Algorithm Design for compatibility and pricing
  - Decision: Rule-Based Compatibility Engine
  - Allows for flexible rules managed through admin interface
  - Provides real-time validation and pricing updates

## Implementation Phase (IMPLEMENT Mode)
- [~] Implementation started - Focused on Quotation System Models (Phase 5)
  - [x] Created `Quotation` and `QuotationItem` models in `backend/src/modules/quote/models`.
  - [x] Created module definition in `backend/src/modules/quote/index.ts`.
  - [x] Registered module in `backend/medusa-config.ts`.
  - [~] Blocked by linter errors (suspected stale TS server state).
- [ ] Product catalog (Phase 2)
- [ ] Configuration system (Phase 3)
- [ ] Compatibility engine (Phase 4)
- [ ] Quotation system (Phase 5) - Services, etc.
- [ ] UI enhancements (Phase 6)
- [ ] Deployment (Phase 7)

## QA Phase (QA Mode)
- [ ] Not started yet (requires implementation phase completion)

## Issues & Blockers
- **Current Blocker:** Linter errors in `backend/src/modules/quote` files (`index.ts`, `models/*.ts`) preventing further progress on Phase 5. Errors include "Cannot find module" for relative paths and potentially decorator resolution issues. Suspected cause is stale TypeScript server state after file restructuring and package installation. **Next Step:** Reload editor/IDE.
