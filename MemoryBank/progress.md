  - Created architecture.md (system architecture, data flow, integration points)
  - Created implementation.md (detailed roadmap, testing strategy, risk management)
  - Created creative-phases.md (UI/UX, architecture, and algorithm design planning)
- [x] Project scope defined and documented
- [x] Implementation strategy outlined
- [x] Creative phases identified and planned
- [x] Risk assessment performed
- [x] Technical documentation added
  - Created objectiveUpdate.md (summary of project objectives)
  - Created medusaDocs.md (Medusa.js documentation reference)

## Creative Phase (CREATIVE Mode)
